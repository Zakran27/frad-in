## 🚀 About This Project

Welcome to my digital den — **frad.in**, hosted on [https://bellab.re](https://bellab.re), is where I mix cool algorithms, silly ideas, and honest tech builds.

This is a side-project-friendly playground, built to be:
- Fast ⚡ (thanks to **Next.js**)
- Stylish 🎨 (with **Tailwind CSS**)
- Easy to scale & extend
- A little bit chaotic (on purpose 😏)

---

## 📦 Features

- 🎯 Project showcase using responsive cards
- 🧠 Fun, exploratory content and concepts
- 🤐 Easter eggs and in-jokes (hello Damien)
- 🌍 Custom domain + Vercel hosting
- 📱 100% mobile responsive
