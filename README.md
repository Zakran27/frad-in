## 🚀 What is `bellab.re`?

This is my digital garage.  
A personal playground where I publish weird, smart, and fun stuff I build with modern web tools. Hosted on [bellab.re](https://bellab.re), this space is intentionally:

- 🔥 Fast (Next.js + Vercel)
- 🧠 Creative (AI, APIs, maps, games)
- 📱 Mobile-friendly
- ✨ Full of easter eggs (👋 Damien)

## 🧪 Featured Projects

- 🎲 **Bendo na Bendo (B2B)**  
  Mini-game to guess if a French rap punchline is real or AI-generated. Uses Supabase for real punchlines and OpenAI API for fakes.

- 🍽 **Restaurant Radar**  
  A Google Maps-based radar for nearby restaurants with filters, cuisine types, ratings and info popups. Built with the Places API.

- 📚 **Talaref**  
  A fun meme encyclopedia of French YouTube culture and "tala refs", backed by Supabase. Supports images, embeds, text, and tweet display.

- 🧼 **Sanity Checker**  
  Just because I needed a space to validate funny data, logic, or JSON things — manually or by script.
